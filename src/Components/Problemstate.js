                <p><span>Description: </span> 
                In the BFSI sector, accurate risk assessment and underwriting are critical for insurance providers to determine appropriate premiums and mitigate potential losses. 
                Traditional underwriting processes often rely on manual analysis of complex data, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. 
                The goal of this hackathon is to develop a generative AI solution that leverages advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to streamline and enhance the underwriting process. 
                Additionally, implement a federated learning framework to enable collaborative model training across multiple insurance providers without sharing sensitive data, addressing privacy concerns.</p>

                <br></br>
                <p><span>Description: </span> Intellectual property (IP) analysis is a crucial task for legal teams, involving the review and assessment of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other IP-related documents. 
                However, this process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, often requiring legal professionals to sift through large volumes of complex technical and legal documentation.
                The goal of this hackathon is to develop a generative AI solution that can streamline and enhance the IP analysis process for legal teams. The solution should leverage state-of-the-art language models and natural language processing techniques 
                to accurately extract relevant information from IP documents, summarize key findings, and generate actionable insights.

                The scraper should navigate app interfaces using computer vision and AI, intelligently identify and extract data through NLP and information extraction techniques, 
                structure extracted data, handle cross-platform compatibility, ensure scalability and efficiency, and incorporate secure user consent and authorization mechanisms.

                Malicious actors target blockchain networks with fraudulent transactions and exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. 
                This hackathon seeks innovative solutions to address the following challenges and bolster Web3 security: 
                Real-time Blockchain Transaction Threat Detection (Mempool Analysis): Develop a system that continuously monitors the mempool (unverified transactions) and 
                identifies potential threats using advanced detection algorithms and machine learning. 
                The solution should: Analyze transaction patterns and identify anomalies. Classify transactions as benign or malicious. Integrate with alerting systems and mitigation strategies. 
                Continuously update models based on new data and feedback. Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection (AST-based Analysis): 
                Design a tool that automatically scans smart contract code (using Abstract Syntax Trees) for vulnerabilities and attack patterns.  The solution should leverage:
                Static and dynamic analysis techniques (symbolic execution, taint analysis, fuzz testing)
                Machine learning models for vulnerability detection.
                Industry-standard vulnerability databases.
                Generate detailed vulnerability reports with mitigation strategies.
                Integrate seamlessly with popular development environments for early detection and remediation.

                <br></br>
                <p><span>Description: </span> The integration of efficient zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) into smart contract platforms is crucial for enhancing privacy and security. However, the computational complexity and gas costs associated with ZKP integration can significantly impact the overall transaction throughput and network performance, limiting the widespread adoption of this technology.
                Develop a solution that can seamlessly integrate efficient ZKP mechanisms into smart contract platforms, ensuring that the integration does not significantly impact the overall transaction throughput or gas costs. The goal is to create a ZKP framework that can be easily adopted by developers, offering a balance between privacy, security, and scalability.

                <br></br>
                <p><span>Description: </span> Wikipedia, a cornerstone of online information access, faces challenges in maintaining neutrality and combating bias.  Centralized control and reliance on editor reputation can hinder diverse representation and lead to information manipulation, as highlighted in the Lex Fridman and Balaji podcast discussion.
                The limitations of centralized information platforms like Wikipedia necessitate a next-generation solution built on Web 3.0 principles. This new platform should address these issues by employing: Decentralized Governance, shifting editorial control from a single entity to a distributed network of users.  Consensus-Driven Curation would be fostered through a robust mechanism (to be determined) for collaboratively validating information accuracy and resolving disputes.  To Incentivize Diverse Participation, the platform would reward users for contributing credible information and actively engaging in the governance process. Finally, Transparency and Immutability would be maintained by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure the information record remains uncensored and verifiable.</p>

                <p><span>Description: </span> 
                Current crypto wallets often require complex seed phrases or private keys, creating a barrier to entry for the average user. Additionally, traditional KYC (Know Your Customer) processes can be cumbersome and deter new entrants to the Web3 space. 
                Integrating user experience (UX) elements commonly seen in successful mobile payment apps (like UPI) is also lacking in many crypto wallets, hindering mainstream adoption.
